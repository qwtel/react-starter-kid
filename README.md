# React YAGNI Starter Kit

Each directory has a `README.md` file documenting its purpose. 

We assume the following:

  * We are using React
  * We are using `npm` to define dependencies
  * We are using `git` for version control
  * We are using a UNIX-ish OS that supports `cp` and `rm`
  * Source files go in `src`
  * Transpiled files get put in `build`
